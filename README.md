# javascriptRaycaster
https://creatorbyte.github.io/javascriptRaycaster/

A simple raycast engine made with p5.js and game development in mind.
I will be porting this to java or C++ later on.

use the arrow keys to move, z and x to break/place blocks, and m to change the map size(It starts off full sized);

TODO:
- ~~Mini-Map~~
- ~~The actual raycasting~~
- ~~Fisheye correction~~
- ~~Breakable/placeable blocks~~
- ~~Basic Texture mapping~~
- Sliding Doors
- Billboard Sprites
- Floor/ceiling textures
- Possibly non-orthogonal walls
- Refactor and code cleanup(Ha! yeah right!)
