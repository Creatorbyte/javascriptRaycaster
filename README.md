# javascriptRaycaster
A simple raycast engine made with p5.js and game development in mind.
I will be porting this to java or C++ later on.

FINISHED:
- Map
- The actual raycasting
- Fisheye correction
- Breakable/placeable blocks

TODO:
- Textures
- Sliding Doors
- Billboard Sprites
- Better Map
- Head Bob
- Multiple levels
